        <p>Playing guitar is rather easy if you compare it with other instruments like violin and flute, but it still has its challenges. To start learn some easy chords like Am, Em ,C and G which are found in almost every song. After that practice transitions from one chord to the other. For example try changing from Am to C and them from Em to G and try to improve these transitions. There are abunch of videos to watch so you can learn how to play guitar but this one is my favourite.</p>

        <p>After you practice transitions and learn these basic chords you can start to play some songs. Ive put 2 songs(riptide and back to friends) that are rather easy and fun to play, so you can start learning some. If you like to learn some more you can search on youtube or on google to find the chords.</p>

        <p>The guitar you see to the left is the one i currently have, the Red Tanglewood Azure which is an electro acoustic. But i started with a classical guitar, which if you ask me was a great way to get the feel of the guitar and learning to play on softer strings. If you want though you can start with and acoustic, an electro acoustic or an electric guitar. My first guitar was the Admira A4 which was kind of expensive. But if you want a cheap option you can always find some used guitars on ebay or you can find some relatively cheap beginer guitar. My first guitar was a 50 euro one that i bought from Lidl.</p>
